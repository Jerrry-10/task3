2. Create a separate React component pulling in the data from an imported file and using Array.map(), render a list of all the product names on the website.

3. Create a separate React component pulling in the data from an imported file and using Array.sort(), sort the products in the array by their price in ascending order.

4. Create a separate React component pulling in the data from an imported file and using Array.filter(), create a new array that only includes the products that are on sale. Render the sale products in a list on the website.
